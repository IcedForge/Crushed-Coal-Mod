1.1 
- Initial public release
- Coal 
Removed its fuel value and it can no longer be used as a direct fuel type due to it being giant blocks.
- Crushed Coal
New block type that can be crushed from Coal and the efficiency is dependent on processing machines, similar to the normal ore production.
- Crushed Mixed Rock 
A mix of crushed rocks not really viable to sort and use for special purposes but only as filler
and it has (crushed rock) tag applied so can be used for instance in road construction.
