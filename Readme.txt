Installing

1.Make sure to remove pre 9.4 installed files.
2.Unzip the files and the UserCode folder should be inside the Mods folder as follows
Server/Mods/UserCode

- Note
Eco 0.9.4.0 had significant directory changes in the mod structure which this mod is now using as of v1.4
meaning you need to make sure you do not have any old files remaining as they will cause duplicate errors.
